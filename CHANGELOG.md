# v0.1.0

First major release of the FIRE pipeline. This release includes a major refactor to reduce the computation by increased use of ft, change output file names to include the fire version among other changes, and finally a new launching method for the pipeline that uses pixi. Results are very similar to v0.0.7 of the pipeline; however, there are minor differences in the peak calls and the output names.
